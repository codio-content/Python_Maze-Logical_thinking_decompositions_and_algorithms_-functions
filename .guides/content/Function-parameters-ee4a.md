One very cool thing you can do with functions is to pass in parameters.

The code on the left shows a scoring function that takes a parameter.

In this example, when we call `calcScore()` we can pass in a value that we want to use in our score calculator. This is then treated in the same way as a variable within the function code block.

## Argument
When we call our `calcScore()` function, it takes one single *argument*. Functions can also have more than one arguments, for example

```python
def multiply(x, y):
  result = x * y
```

The above function has 2 arguments.

## Parameters
When we look at things from the function's point-of-view, we refer to `x` and `y` as *parameters*. 

So arguments and parameters are more or less the same thing.
