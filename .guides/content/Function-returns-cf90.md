The last thing we want to explain about functions is that a function can return a value to the calling function.

The code on the left shows an example of this. It's really quite easy. If we want to return a value to the calling function, we simply use the `return` statement.

`calcScore` returns a number, in order to combine it to a string with the `+` symbol we need to first convert it to a string using the built-in `str()` function. This function takes a number as a parameter and returns a string.
